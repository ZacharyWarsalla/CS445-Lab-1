# CS445-Lab-1

This lab uses matplotlib and pandas combined with a computer hardware data set to visualize 
different aspects of the data including performance relative to machine cycle time, the performance
of all processor in the data set, the amount of maximum memory used with each processor, and the
performance relative to each processor vendor.

To recreate Q2 use a bar graph with bins of 30ns intervals and group by the mean of the PRP.

To recreate Q3 use a line graph to display the PRP of all processors in the data set.

To recreate Q4 create a pie chart with 4mb bins of the MMAX values.

To recreate Q5 create a boxplot without outliers using a group of vendor names and PRP.
